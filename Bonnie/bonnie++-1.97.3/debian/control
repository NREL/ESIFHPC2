Description: Hard drive benchmark suite
 Based on the old Bonnie benchmark, Bonnie++ is a toolkit for testing
 hard drive and file system performance.
 .
 As well as bonnie++ itself and some output filters, the suite provides
 some other benchmarking tools including zcav, which can compare the
 raw-read performance of different zones on a drive, and gives output
 suitable for gnuplot.
